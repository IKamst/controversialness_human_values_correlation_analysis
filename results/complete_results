d4mpfja,"There is no reason why a teacher should try and have you memorize every single detail in a history book. But, it's completely reasonable to teach the main themes of American history in a year. Yes, there is a memorization component (learning names and a few specific main details), but learning history in general is more than memorization of facts. History at an academic level is more about understanding the different social, economic, military, political, etc. forces at work during a specific time period, understanding how that was reflected in the events of the time and also how the events of the time shaped these forces themselves. Once again, this seems to be more about poor teaching methods than the material itself.

A teacher should not be teaching you every detail about what happened. That's what reading your textbook is for. For example, my APUSH teacher would have random 5-min reading quizzes just to make sure we were reading and getting the details. Instead, a teacher should be teaching you the big picture and clarifying questions you have about the details and how they affect the big picture.

d4n8pmm,"I've never had that experience with AP classes. Perhaps your teachers weren't good. Most of my teachers would go beyond what is on the test.

&gt;Compare this to an Honors or a CP (standard-level) course, where teachers are able to design lessons to fit the needs of their class. They can assign projects that relate to student interests and conduct lessons in a way that makes them passionate, which can contribute to an effective learning environment. Getting students invested can make them more likely to be invested in later classes in related subjects, or even to pursue a career in that field.

I don't have statistics, but I feel for the vast majority of public (maybe even private) schools in the US, this isn't true. Teachers are constantly teaching the standardized test. Even worse, these test can be completely ruined by the state. For instance, the state glosses over US history way more than AP does in some states. 

&gt;The flexibility also allows teachers to cater to different learning styles and performance levels. Even at an AP level, people learn differently. Students would be much more engaged with the lessons - much more likely to learn - if their individual needs were met.

In my experience, the teachers usually cater to the kids who aren't as intelligent in standard classes. The class is constantly being slowed down for people who have a hard time understanding the subject. Also, in a class with 20+ people, the teacher won't be able to cater to everyone's learning style.

I would say that especially in the humanities courses we learned at an accelerated pace and went much more in depth than standard classes because a lot of the basic material was covered in the textbooks.  This allowed us to discuss the text in class and really engage with the material.  That may just be my experience (my school is extremely successful with all APs), but I think I may have some more objective benefits to the AP program.

Unless your school does this strangely, I don't think that you can take a real calculus course in high school unless it is an AP class.  There's no standard level calculus is what I'm saying, so AP benefits you down the line there by allowing you to get a groundwork for calculus before entering college.

Backtracking a bit to the subjective, but I also found the atmosphere of AP classes to just be better for learning.

d4n81s0,"Some background for this: I attend an academically (and athletically, but that's irrelevant :P) well-regarded private catholic high school in Georgia. We do not have honors classes, though there are tracks that are considered more advanced (Intro to Analysis vs Calc in Junior).Experiences could differ on average, public v private, by state, or many other measures. 

This year (Junior) I took two A.P. Classes, which you also took!: U.S. History and English Language and Composition. I'm going to outline my experiences in both, and my previous A.P. Euro class (bundling it with U.S.), then directly respond to your post (feel free to skip to that, though I will reference the classes in it).

* U.S./Euro History: I personally enjoyed both of these classes very much; however, there is likely a slight bias as I enjoy history very much. Both of these classes *did* feel as though they were rushing to cover all content before the deadline (the A.P. Test). As a result, the class was primarily lecture oriented. This is not my favorite formula for a class; however, there were several mitigating factors. In both classes, it was *heavily* emphasized that we should be focusing on the broader picture, not the details. In addition, both teachers were extremely knowledgeable about the subject (this could just be all AP teachers, but both graded A.P. Tests. My U.S. Teacher was also involved in creating the test for many years before she quit that). On a little more minor note, they both provided the notes online which was awesome :D. That pretty much sums them up; heavily lecture oriented and content focused, but still very interesting and well done. I should also mention that there was a good amount of detail on tests, but the level of memorization was not obscene. As an example, we'd need to list the order of events leading up the American Revolution, but not the exact dates of any of them.
* A.P. Lang: By far my favorite (serious) class in High School so far, A.P. Lang was radically different than either history class. In the class, there was very little focus on, well, learning about language and composition haha. To clarify, she structured the class around a variety of Units in which we would read and analyze pieces of writings and other mediums arguing two sides of a modern issue (race, gender, the influence of technology, etc). We would then have either whole-class or smaller group discussion and debate about the issue. During these, she would take a mainly hands-off approach except to try to make sure everyone got a voice. Finally, we were assigned a ""summative unit assessment"" in which we would write, generally, a paper of our own arguing our own position on the issue. She would try to encourage variety by making emphasizing certain styles or techniques of delivery though. I.E. we had to deliver a pecha kucha on whatever issue we wanted- 2 minutes of memorized talking while a slideshow rolls behind you. We would also periodically have separate papers that would be on the A.P. Test such as Rhetorical Analysis and that paper where you are given sources to use :P. Long story short; awesome teacher who incorporated feedback, encouraged open-mindedness, and the course did not feel rushed to cover content at all.  

Finally, time for my actual response :P. There are very clearly A.P. classes which have a heavy focus on content, and the A.P. test sets a hard limit in which they must fit that content in. This can limit creative teaching styles. However, in my experience (no studies on this, sorry D:), the courses in which this is true behave similarly outside of A.P. All of my histories have been the same style; they simply had less stress to fit everything in. In contrast, my A.P. Lang class was far better than the other English classes I've had so far, though I loved those as well. Thus, my argument is that, while A.P. Classes can add greater pressure, the experience is still completely dependent on the teacher. If you have teachers who are not passionate about the subject (all of mine really were), as you indicated yours weren't, than the class will likely be lackluster, regardless of level. One thing that I've noticed is that there is always room to be creative while teaching a subject. My U.S. Teacher would take large amounts of time for us to discuss politics in the U.S. today. She would also take the opportunity to draw connections between the subject and our world today. To me, this made the information that we were learning feel more important and relevant; she could have also taken that time to experiment with different teaching styles. A poor teacher will easily take the deadline as an excuse not to experiment, but that doesn't mean it can't be done. 

TLDR: A.P.'s can place greater pressure on teachers to cover content, but in the end the quality of the course is just as dependent on the teacher as any other class.

Sorry for the monster post xD.

AP courses are intended to have college or university level curricula. Not high school. You're comparing them to honors and standard level classes, neither of which are comparable to AP. I concur with a number of the other comments here that the issue may be with the teacher or the school, as I can say that from my own experience all those years ago I had a number of excellent teachers for my AP classes (even U.S. History) that made the courses fun and engaging. It would be great if all teachers were so skilled, but they are not. I can assure you that in the vast majority of university classes, the onus is on the student to learn the material. You may get lucky and have a professor or TA that makes things more interesting, but it is not their responsibility to do so. The presumption in a university is that, since you have elected to enroll in certain classes, you have a desire to do the work and learn the information. Many classes can be exceedingly difficult and tackle vast amounts of material, but it is up to the student to take the initiative and learn it.

Before these, I took mostly honors classes. My experience with honors and standard level classes was absolutely atrocious. In a school that really prided itself on the diversity of its students, the learning levels in standard classrooms was equally diverse. Teachers were actually forced to teach to the test in a much greater way, since part of their evaluations and compenstation was determined by the results that their students achieved on standardized testing. Therefore, much of the teaching and lesson plans were geard towards the worst perfoming children in the classroom, those least likely to attain good results on the exam, and the highest return on investment for teacher metrics. Your response to this is the honors level class. Unfortunately, I also finished school in a system that was really proud of its objective metrics, one of which was the number of students taking honors level classes. The threshold for entering these classes was made low, and the same systemic issues emerged in these setting as at the standard level.

In high school, I took 12 AP classes/tests.  I scored 3 or higher on 11 of them, including Physics, Chemistry, English, Government, Calculus, and Statistics.

When I got to college, that meant all of those classes were gone for me.  Being in a very math-intensive major with a lot of homework, the reduced stress of not having to do all of it on TOP of statistics and chemistry allowed me to focus on my actual core classes, rather than spending all of my time powering through low-level gen-ed classes that I already knew everything about.  

That allowed me to succeed with fairly low stress, where I otherwise would have been undoubtedly stretched far too thin, and probably not been able to pull it off in four years.

d3nuspi,"I think that something you're probably going to run into a lot here is, what you call 'gender' in this case, some would refer to as 'gender roles', stereotypes, trends and averages... Regardless of this difference in naming... The way I see this is, while some of the arbitrary, such as blue vs pink, on the other hand a number of behavioural differences could be tied to the reproductive system (subconsciously), for instance men on average being more promiscuous could be because to them sex has high rewards with low costs, because they can't get pregnant. And women might be more prone to caretaking because it might be more rewarding to them (on average) seeing as most mammals the mother is the one that takes care of the youth, ie. With breatfeeding and whatnot, it would make sense that their brains were wired reward (oxytocin?) to encourage this behaviour more frequently than men, even though now we have milk bottles and baby formula.... Anyway, I'm sure you can see what I am getting there, I don't mean all men or all women, just that the biological differences probably have an impact on statistical averages, and I am under the impression that it is a bad idea to judge people based solely off their (non)conformity to the norms regardless of origin, and that people should do what ever the hell they want.

d3nq637,"Expressions of gender are certainly influenced by culture, but behaviors and reactions to stimuli are heavily influenced by your anatomical sex no matter which culture you hail from. This is simply biology. 

Some expressions of gender are derived from natural behavior of the two sexes, whereas some are derived from society. 

Aggression and strength are associated with masculinity; nurturing and hospitality are associated with femininity. This is because of our hormones: testosterone and estrogen. Typically, females have higher estrogen than males, and males have higher testosterone than females. This aspect of gender expression is physiological. 

Men who are less aggressive and more nurturing can get a blood test that will reveal lower testosterone levels and elevated estrogen levels. Women who are less nurturing and more aggressive can get a blood test that will reveal lower estrogen levels and elevated testosterone levels. But on average, men and women's hormone levels will be within a typical range that accounts for traditional expectations of gender expression.

&gt;but biologically there are only two genders, male and female

This is oxymoronic to most people's definition, male and female are not genders, they are anatomical sexes. Gender is the social (man/masculine or woman/feminine), sex is the biological (male/female). 

Call it Gender Roles if you like but it's still a societal or cultural construct. Think of this way, some prehistoric culture has women who gather and men who hunt. Except one woman who hunts. If gender was biological there is no reason for the woman to hunt. The idea that gender roles are not attached to biological sex shows that they are constructs and that they are not always followed. 

The best way i think i can argue it is forget about gender and only use Gender roles. That's what gender is, the role/place/ideas that you get from the society you are in.

It's fact that women have been found in what are ""male"" burials and men have been found in what are female burials. There are numerous archaeological and ethnographic accounts of these processes. All of that is real. Can I assume to know what other people think? No. But neither can you. If I can't assume to know how other socities think I would ask you not to take the same liberty in your argument. As it is we have to make assumptions based on evidence. The evidence suggests that your biological sex did not solely determine if you were treated as a man or woman in numerous cultures around the world.

Now if we accept/assume that gender is societal then the chance that other societies would have different ideas on gender makes sense. The evidence suggests that the the organs you had did not completely define how were treated. The fact you were born female did not stop you being buried as a man, or vice versa. Now i can't know why or what they thought, but I can know that the evidence suggests that many cultures did not have a simple idea of gender that corresponded to anatomical sex. 

Even if I grant you biology though, which biological indicators are we talking about? You can say its all about organs, but there's examples of cultures treating appearance as a factor in gender. If you a rather effeminate looking male child you would be treated differently from other men. Why is that wrong? Many would argue how you look determines how you will be treated much more than what anatomical sex you are.

&gt;you are assuming these societies view on multiple genders is real just because people thought they were, and that there is a third gender

No, I'm assuming that no-ones views on gender are ""real"" because they are all societal constructs based on a large number of factors from sexual organs, appearence, spiritual beliefs and how they conducted their life. You are assuming that all other cultures views are wrong, except your own.

We created them because we're intelligent animals that think about things, most commonly gender is linked to biology i'm not arguing that fact, but the fact that the two are linked does not make them the same.

Second, this could introduce a power dynamics, where the people who went to military form an ""old boys network"", helping each other out and whatnot, but ignore the rest of the population.

If you open your eyes and look around you, you will realise every facet of a functioning society doesn't need to point guns at people's heads to get things done. From healthcare to sewage treatment, the required labor is met through fluctuations in payout. To put it simply, if you need more workers, increase the pay. Taxes are adjusted appropriately.

&gt;What if this state is the only thing that stands between you, and genocide of your family, your heritage, your culture, your language, and everything you stand for. What if this culture that threatens your existence is looking for ANY possible excuse to smite you... and all hands are needed on deck.

If the existential threat is so great, there will be no shortage of volunteers.

&gt;Your ability to reject this supposed social contract can imply that you do not believe you have the right to live. And many young people can not imagine the scale of hatred that does exist in the world. They can read about it but never experience it first hand. It is not as real to them than the veterans who have seen it.

Irrelevant, because the right to live has never been associated with compulsory military service.

&gt;Difference here being that dates are usually voluntary. Your right to live is either a fundamental right that is worth dying for, or a privilege the moment you feel inconvenienced.

You're not making sense. You're saying that you're not entitled to use someone else on a voluntary date, because it's voluntary, but it's ok to use someone if you threaten them with jail? So if I go on a date and point a gun at their head, suddenly it becomes ok?

&gt;In the face of an existential crisis, many things become permissible that otherwise shouldn't. There is a reason that in older wars that cowards were put to the front lines, court marshaled, or shot. The idea is that we must be brave and strong together else we all shall perish. And if we are lucky, the cowards lose their rights in society, are killed first, or possibly killed first. Cowardice is treasonous.

The real cowards here are the ones who shoot other people for disagreeing with them. You aren't any braver than the person at the end of your barrel, and you aren't doing your argument any favors by indicating that you'll just shoot whoever doesn't concede to be your slave.

People work jobs they hate so they can feed their kids and then when they are taxed they feel like they wasted their time because they hate their job.

d8xvi9k,"One thing to consider is that, over time, society heads left. It's very interesting, and there's a very good article discussing it by moldbug that attributes this movement as political entropy. Indeed, with more power/freedom flowing to the individual (women, people of color, homosexuals, etc), from a state of hierarchical structure, then the idea that an individual generation goes the opposite direction as it ages doesn't really make sense does it? I am not going to try to convince you that the average person becomes more conservative as they grow older. What I will try to convince you of is that this idea is NOT made up for a particular agenda.

Starting off, the anecdotal evidence. When I grew up, it was in the panhandle of Texas. The ol' god-fearing republican communities that as a teenager I grew to view as stupid red necks. Over a few years, I became an anarcho-capitalist and very much embraced a lot of liberal views on social policies such as abortion and gay rights. 

After a period of time my interests strayed from politics and economics into philosophy and so on. Then I remained stagnant in a depression for a handful of years. The past two years have been the most formative of my entire life, and as I've become more politically minded again, I've become a lot more conservative again.

In this very forum I challenged my view on abortion, as the prospect of having a kid is becoming a real one. I used to just think abortions were a net good in the world and that was that. I've grown to hold more value for the sanctity of life. If I had a kid, I imagine that familial values would lend themselves to valuing structure, which would give credence to more conservative ideas pervading my social and political views of the world around me. My views on immigration have changed and for the first time in my life I'm starting to feel what I think is a sense of national pride. I want this country to be strong and prosperous and not a dumping ground for the rest of the world's problems. Just as I was against interventionism in my teen years, I'm against globalization for the SAME reasons almost 1 to 1. I could go on and with examples from my life but I think you get it. In my experience, from my teenage years, into my adult life (coming on 30, it's scary), I'm becoming way more conservative than I ever though...and I even find myself using phrases that I used to attribute to just dumb redneck viewpoints. It gives me a lot more respect for people who are older than me. 

Another angle to look at it is that in the minds of the young, it's easy to be idealist. Liberal viewpoints tend to be future oriented and forward moving. Conservatism basically maintaining the status quo. In that sense, the wide-eyed kid will likely identify with liberalism. But as we age and grow and have loved and lost and learn to not just want things but to appreciate what we already have...When we find the things that make us happy and just want to keep them. I feel like those very core mindsets bleed into politics in a very powerful way. 

Again, this was not intended to convince you that the majority or even the average person grows more conservative with age (certainly with the small c you mention they do though), but that the idea of people becoming conservative with age does have a reasonable place in the world, with factual examples (such as my case), and that it's not just some made up notion pushing an agenda.

The thing is, this is true to an extent. And it's not at all a bad thing.  Statistically, millenials need more incentivizing to get out and vote compared to older people. And man I'll never forget the first time I thought, ""damn kids"" to myself and laughed at myself becoming the cranky old man stereotype. Those stereotypes stem from portions of truth and have little to nothing to do with left and right wing political positioning. So again, I don't think there's any degree of agenda tied to to these depictions of generational differences.

d8v967b,"Regarding the paucity of studies showing the age =&gt; Conservative effect:  There is a bias to publish studies *in the popular press* [and to a lesser extent a bias against conducting them] that violate some aspect of the 'common wisdom'.  Can you imagine the Vox headline 'Scientists prove that dogs have an attachment to their owners'?  What about 'New science indicates that dogs actually have a psychological urge to kill the owners!'  Were there to be an agent or publicist out there pushing each of these studies, the latter would likely be much more successful in our current environment.  

One model currently popular in Psychology, the [Five Factor Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits), has two metrics that a diminution of appear indirectly relevant to an increase in attraction to Conservative politics: openness to experience, and agreeableness.  

Many consider it established that both of these 'personality traits' [diminish with age](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7337585_Patterns_of_Mean-Level_Change_in_Personality_Traits_Across_the_Life_Course_A_Meta-Analysis_of_Longitudinal_Studies).  

Physiologically, it is well established that [neural plasticity decreases with age](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2596698/), which may explain the personality changes, and a decrease in an extremely important trait we call 'curiosity'.

They don't want to have to learn about GLBT issues, they don't want to hear unfamiliar languages spoken on the bus (esp. Esp ;) ), they don't want to know what 'Climate Change' means, or why we should invest in 'Green Energy'.  Maybe part of the reason for this is [almost] literally *their brain hurts* [i.e. they don't have enough neural plasticity]

Here's an article about how [Conservatism can be related to *self esteem*](http://fulltext.study/preview/pdf/891719.pdf) in the aged.  

It is work to keep up with new technologies, many of us have had experiences with trying to teach our grandma's how to use 'The Email' or some such thing.  Often the aged have a negative response *to the technologies* themselves, one may hear 'Oh these stupid kids are just on their phones all day they aren't out there actually living' or something like that.  Perhaps to some extent this is a psychological defense mechanism: 'I don't *need* to learn this new technology because... well... it's stupid!'

Social technologies are no different.  Part of [good] Liberalism is [to attempt to do] social engineering-- to try to make 'progress', to welcome change.  The unfamiliar can be discomforting if not downright terrifying.  Combine fear of the unknown with laziness to expand the 'known' and you have a recipe for preferring the Conservative agenda.

You seem to have changed what it means to be a Big C conservative.
  
""Big C"" Conservative, I thought meant you identified with the ""true"" Conservative party? The distinction makes little sense in the USA, where there really are only two parties. It makes some sense in the UK, Canada and other similar countries where you have centre right/left parties and a further right/left party as well. In the US context I have to agree with /u/hapaxTwin, small c seems to imply general support for big c. There's no other game in town than the Republican party for conservatives. Libertarians, ought to, be far too reprehensible for social conservatives (which seems to be the main motivation for conservatism), so even that ""party"" isn't a real contender.

While it's true older generations are consistently more ""Conservative"" than younger ones, the Conservative platforms and policies change as time passes. But that doesn't mean the older generations changed their minds and picked up the exact specific beliefs the generation before them claimed they were going to pick up.

I guess that's a better way to reword my question: do younger generations adopt the precise political beliefs the generation before them claims they will adopt with age (whatever those beliefs may be) as they actually age?

As for small ""c"" implying big ""C"", small ""c"" is rooted in the idea of maintaining the status quo. Each generation has a different status quo of institutions and beliefs they try to maintain, so it's not really accurate.

d8vehq7,"1. I'd suggest responding to my own [response](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/57u1uc/cmv_the_idea_people_become_more_conservative_as/d8vba3w). I suspect a crucial point of disagreement is whether or not you can come up with a non-context derived notion of the components of Big C conservatism (e.g. can you come up with a reasonable notion of ""small government"" that avoids this issue and yet encapsulates all that we want by such a term in the relevant political debates?).
  
2. The way you've defined Big C conservatism is extremely narrow to the point where the whole question goes out the window. Big C Conservatism now only becomes relevant as a term to very recent history (e.g. it's no longer relevant to an era where gay marriage wasn't a political issue because everyone thought it was absurd). 

3. Which gets to your reworded question, which seems to be different from the original. It's first covering a wider scope of beliefs than the original question. In this sense, it moves away from the adage that was originally going to be discussed. Second, it's clearly false or largely unverifiable as you do state ""precise political beliefs,"" as it's such a strong claim that it's hopelessly unlikely to be supported. 

4. I'm not sure I'm allowed to respond to the revised question on this subreddit. If it's anything like formal debate, you aren't supposed to shift the prompt or mutilate it anyway. Of course, it assumes that there's a well crafted prompt to discuss ([this is an example of a badly crafted prompt](http://www.intelligencesquared.com/events/karl-marx/)).",0,1476684823,1kon,[0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]
d8vfxqn,"1. I already responded. My apologies, I took my time a bit with your comment.

2. Thing is, that's not how *I* personally defined Big C conservatism. I'm merely referencing a claim that's often made about the younger generations (usually) by the older generations, but the claim was not initially mine.

3. I don't think my reworded question is different from the original. Another way to put it is to ask the same question as in the title but with *relative to today's time period* in brackets after the word ""Conservative"". Also by ""precise political beliefs"", I can boil that down to right-wing economic policies, an interventionist foreign policy, and some form of social legislation (gay marriage might not be on the platform where you live but it's still on the Republican platform as of 2016). It doesn't have to get more precise than that. Honestly, I would even be ok with responders only focusing on one of the three.

4. It's also not a revised question since I didn't ""reconsider and alter [it] in the light of further evidence"" (the Google definition).

However, I believe that a compatible claim is that as voters, of a particular generation, they are more likely to identify as conservatives within their local political spectrum as they age. As such, the claim that we start off as liberals and become conservatives seems to have some merit. Let me proceed to defend this claim (although your comment about ""small c"" conservatives seems to indicate that you wouldn't find this problematic). 
  
The first thing to note is that the terms ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" are highly dependent on context for their semantic content, as are terms like ""small government."" What it means to be for ""small government"" now doesn't mean the same thing as it means to be for ""small government"" a century ago. Similarly, what it means to support a ""large federal government"" is also context dependent. For example, no mainstream small government conservative is against an income tax, but a century ago, that view would be seen as radical. 
  
But let's turn to the study you mentioned. An important conclusion from that is we ought to remember that the ""conservative"" older generation has moved from a much more conservative set of views to their current views. This is key, people do become more liberal, but within the larger political sphere their views are no longer seen as being progressive or radical, they are seen as conservative or even reactionary. I remember a professor of mine remarking that they felt so divorced from the current feminist movement, at one point in time they were out there on the streets marching and protesting, but now? They're the stodgy old professor with just a mainstream set of views. It's the question of what happens to the progressives when they win, they're clearly no longer progressives unless they keep updating their views, that seems to be true by definition (the progressives are the vanguard of a movement). So yes, we see evidence for the view that a generation's views, generally, become more ""liberal"" over time (up to a point).
  
But let's look at some other information. [Here's a Guardian story](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/03/do-we-become-more-conservative-with-age-young-old-politics) and a [Pew Research Center article](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/07/09/the-politics-of-american-generations-how-age-affects-attitudes-and-voting-behavior/) on the issue. If we look at the Guardian article we do see evidence of a generation increasingly identifying with the Conservative party. If we look at the [relevant study](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/cohort_voting_20140605.pdf) in the Pew article we see evidence for the type of plateauing I was referencing, after a point in our lives, our views become tend to be less malleable. And recalling the fact that the terms that you've mentioned are highly context dependent, we do have evidence for the claim that ""You're a liberal now, but as you get older you'll be a conservative."" It just isn't because your views are ""regressing"", rather because you're just not keeping up with the rest of society's pace of change. 

Furthermore, I would argue that my interpretation makes more sense than the other interpretation, and isn't just playing with words. These terms are in fact context-dependent, there's no getting around that. Even an appeal to being pro-small government and traditional values doesn't do much more than kick the can down the road. Those things are also indexed to the generation/society. 
  
  
I also have disagreements with the second part of your view. It seems odd to say that the reason that this myth, if it is one, was created and propagated was to merely dismiss the views of a younger generation. First, it seems to fly in the face of one's own personal experience. After all, I would imagine the older generation would remember their own transition. Second, I think you might be confusing this issue for another related issue. 

The dismissive rationale seems to hold much more water when you're faced with youthful naivete or idealism (traits which would be associated with the ""liberals"" I suppose). And it's here where in fact I do here the rejoinder that ""as you grow up your views will change to take into account of reality."" And that, in fact, seems true- my views and the views of many in my generation did go from support for unrealistic ideas to a more measured set of views that made much more room for realpolitik. I remember an argument I was having with my younger cousin who lives in the US. We were arguing about whether Clinton should have adopted Sander's view on universal health care. I was saying that she shouldn't and my cousin was saying she should. I, a person who lives in a country with universal healthcare and thinks it's a good idea for most countries, told him rather dismissively to ""grow up."" This was not exactly my best moment, but it was after some time of pointing out that there are far greater issues that Clinton would need to address in her presidency, and the fight for universal healthcare would be a waste of political capital in light of far more immediate concerns. 
  
Anyways, I hope that addressed some of your points. And let me take a moment to express my great dislike for the term ""liberal."" It means so little- the liberal ideology has won, in the same way that mixed-market economies have won. There's no question we're all liberals, and we're liberals in a sense that's gone beyond classical liberalism. We all support the rights of individuals and in fact ""conservatives"" make use of liberal rational all the time when they want to support some of their views. And of course, there's the obvious fact that it's all indexed to different societies. Progressive is a far better label, at least that's obviously a term that shifts over time, and seems to better capture the disagreement. And the USA is just weird, this whole two party system where you have economic ""conservatives"" aligned with social conservatives is just so odd. You also have a weird libertarian party that at best is a caricature of libertarian political philosophy, and at worst becomes another arm of an anti-liberal bloated socially conservative set of views which holds up figures like Ayn Rand for admiration (which in case you don't know, she's hated by unequivocally by libertarian philosophers).

d8vigul,"I might have spoken too loosely there. If use is meaning or is crucial to meaning, then liberal,now, seems to mean left-wing. There's also the issue of what ""left-wing"" or ""right-wing"" meant in the time of philosophers like Locke, Voltaire and Montesquieu). My issue is just that I find it distasteful since it seems to have certain connotations that seem unfounded. Furthermore, unlike many other terms whose meanings have changed over time, ""liberal"" seems to be a very slippery term. It can be whatever you want in the same country in the same period, it can be a slur or a badge of honour, it can be a non-descript label or something substantive, etc. It's irritating, but I suppose a fair argument can be made that ""liberal"" means ""left-wing"" (provided left-wing means something like ""progressive"").

d8vfei3,"&gt; As I understand it, your view is in two parts. The first is that the view that the relevant generation of the electorate, generally, starts off ""liberal"" and becomes progressively more ""conservative"" is false. The second is that this myth was primarily crafted in order to delegitimize someone's views.

That's correct.

&gt; I share sympathies with the first part of your claim, at least in some sense. I believe that the electorate in Western liberal English-speaking democracies that aren't facing severe pressures actually do become somewhat more ""liberal"", but they do tend to plateau after a point. This is a view that is confirmed by the study you linked. However, I believe that a compatible claim is that as voters, of a particular generation, they are more likely to identify as conservatives within their local political spectrum as they age. As such, the claim that we start off as liberals and become conservatives seems to have some merit. Let me proceed to defend this claim (although your comment about ""small c"" conservatives seems to indicate that you wouldn't find this problematic).

I don't find it problematic at all.

I actually slightly regret the way I worded it. I think a more accurate worded question would have been ""Do younger generations pick up the same political beliefs the older generations claim they will pick up as they get older?"" While it's true studies show people become more conservative, almost none of the studies I've seen ever account for the fact the definitions of ""conservatives"" and ""liberal"" constantly change. Even the Guardian article you linked makes the same mistake (the policies of UK's Conservative Party will naturally change with the definition of ""conservatism"", as will those of Canada's Conservative Party and of the Republicans). Does that mean tomorrow's conservatives will share the same beliefs as today's conservatives? Will the average Millennial today reach age 40 and go ""Oops, grandma and grandpa were right, universal healthcare is a no-no""? Those are the kind of questions I'm interested in, and so far I haven't found any solid evidence to suggest that it's true (for reasons already stated). But we seem to be on the same page when it comes to that.

If anything, the very fact our views become less malleable with age is a strong indicator that it's **not** true. It would be highly unlikely for a whole generation to do a 180 shift in their beliefs past a certain age, wouldn't it? And then there's the quote from the very Pew Research Center poll you posted:

&gt; Pew Research Center surveys over the past two decades also have found compelling evidence that generations carry with them the imprint of early political experiences.

That kinda proves my point, doesn't it?

&gt; I also have disagreements with the second part of your view. It seems odd to say that the reason that this myth, if it is one, was created and propagated was to merely dismiss the views of a younger generation. First, it seems to fly in the face of one's own personal experience. After all, I would imagine the older generation would remember their own transition.

I'm not sure personal experience is a good indicator when talking of overall generational trends. I wouldn't call it worthless, but you do need a study of some sort to track down each generation's political beliefs (which I already provided).

Personal experience also exposes a conflicting narrative among the older crowd. On one hand there's the common claim that the current younger gen will outgrow their beliefs and adopt the beliefs of the older gen (the topic of this thread). On the other hand there's the moral panic and hysteria over just how *different* this generation is from the old - supporting gay marriage, wanting free college and free healthcare, wanting more for less work, etc. The second idea implies these are relatively foreign concepts to the older generations that they never held, hence the outcry. But it's an idea that's incompatible with the idea that the older generations once held those same positions to the same extent only to outgrow them. If the latter was true, wouldn't all the panic and accusations thrown at the Millennials be an illogical waste of time? It would be the equivalent of doing a serious critique on how little kids these days don't eat their veggies. Everyone knows that's a habit most kids will outgrow, hence why no one makes a fuss about it. By that same logic there should be no fuss made about the beliefs of the younger generations.

d8vi0lb,"So I'm going to respond to both comments here.
  
&gt;Thing is, that's not how I personally defined Big C conservatism.
  
So this is part of the issue. Big C conservatism, as its used here (Canada) and the UK, seems to refer to a term that is indexed. It merely refers to those that identify with the prominent ""true"" conservative party. There isn't anything more tied to it than that. As such, it seemed to me that you had selected a rather narrow notion. 
  
&gt;It's also not a revised question
  
&gt;I don't think my reworded question is different from the original.
  
I disagree with you. It is revised, you decided that the original wording, after my response (and possibly others), failed to convey what you meant to express. This doesn't mean that you've changed your mind regarding the actual proposition you wanted to put forth, it merely means that you think that you changed your mind about how the proposition was worded. You haven't revised your position, but the question itself has been revised. Of course, this is precisely the issue I'm facing- to me the reworded/revised question is different in its semantic content. 
  
A good way to see if propositions mean the same things is the *salva veritate* test (or you can use similar tests that look at epistemic conditions or social conditions, sort of what the philosophers Paul Grice and Peter Strawson refer to in their response to Quine- same problem arises). This merely asks us to substitute the expressions in place of each other and see if they have exactly the same truth conditions. Of course, this is not a perfect test, but its roughly suited for our purposes. The relevant portion of the original proposition would be:

&gt;the view that the relevant generation of the electorate, generally, starts off ""liberal"" and becomes progressively more ""conservative"" is false.

The revised/reworded proposition reads might read as:
  
""It is not the case that younger generations adopt the precise political beliefs the generation before them claims they will adopt with age (whatever those beliefs may be) as they actually age."" 

The first proposition is still true if two compatible things are also true. If the older generation claims the newer generation will become more liberal as they age. And, the relevant generation starts off ""conservative"" and becomes more ""liberal"" over time. The second proposition is made false when this same state of affairs occurs, which seems to leads me to think that these propositions are in fact expressing different propositions. And of course, the most recent iteration of the question/proposition has a different set of conditions also. 
  
&gt;almost none of the studies I've seen ever account for the fact the definitions of ""conservatives"" and ""liberal"" constantly change. Even the Guardian article you linked makes the same mistake 
  
Well, they don't account for the specific political views because the adage/conventional political idea, as normally appreciated/expressed (as the Guardian article addresses and my experiences seem to reflect), refers to a change in political affiliation, or position on a political spectrum, not the specific views they hold. As each generation ages they, generally, become more likely to identify with the conservative political party in their locale. This isn't a mistake or a failure to take into account a specific feature- they're addressing what they take to be the salient adage/conventional idea. 
  
This becomes extremely clear if you try to change the terms you used from ""small government"" or ""right-wing politics"" to describe the specific things that they believe. It dissolves any motivation for the claim you intended to speak on. Of course, at that point, you still have to specify the most important features of what it is to be Conservative (are you still a conservative if you've shifted from ""right-wing economics,"" but are still socially conservative?).

The other view is almost absurd, as you seem to grasp, it makes no sense of how change has occurred or seems to paint a highly implausible view. Any progress would seem rather mysterious, what with the whole electorate being progressively more conservative. It would also seem rather odd to imagine where this large upswell of progressive ideas is coming from and why it's able to so successfully infect the youth. This absurdity is why this interpretation of the adage is largely held to be uncontroversially false. 
  
&gt; I'm not sure personal experience is a good indicator when talking of overall generational trends.
  
That's not what I was trying to do. I was not contesting the trend, whether it be about specific political beliefs or party affiliation. It was about whether the phenomenon primarily was created and propagated to dismiss the experiences of the youth. That's what I'm contesting here, the second part of your claim, not the first. 
  
&gt;I would imagine the older generation would remember their own transition
  
The transition I'm referring to here isn't the transition from the beliefs of their youth to the beliefs that are now ""progressive."" Rather I'm referring to the transition from their own conservative to progressive beliefs- the claim that you would move in the reverse would fly in the face of the older generation's own experience. It would seem odd to so quickly forget that over time you eventually held more progressive ideas. Of course, this does not stop you from dismissing the ideas of *this* generation because of some features you think are unique to it (think of the stereotype that many people hold about millenials- its not about youth *per se* it's about all that's wrong with *this* generation).

d8v31cr,"  When you're young you can't really grasp the complexities and subjective nuance of life. Younger people tend to deal in absolutes more often and lack experience. No matter how much you study and memorize, nothing can compare with experience. Add on top of that having a longer amount of time on earth to think about those things it's hard not to change your views slightly.  It is is usually meant in this context, it is used on both sides conservative and liberal to make the same point.

He gets older he sees that Socialism and Communism have just as many flaws as capitalism so become disillusioned nearly by learning more and understanding in a greater context.  He learns that there are a million questions he can't answer in life so he focuses on the ones he has control over. He's no longer wanting to be a liberal activists in the same way he was when he was younger.

d8vegoj,"I think you might be reading into the idea of ""people become more Conservative as they grow older"" a little bit. I have the good fortune of being able to speak as a millennial who found a passion for the study of Economics fairly early on. In my experience, the idea of people becoming more fiscally Conservative as they grow old begins and ends with level of individual education and life experience. 

The reality is that the expression, ""there are no free lunches"", is completely true. Always. College students, and consequently most current millennials who do not have careers in things like business and economics, *vehemently* reject this. 

Take education for example. Once upon a time, you could actually work and pay your way through a decent college in this country. Today, that idea is fantasy. If you think real education costs rising 300% in the last 25 years is due to anything other than government subsidies, I've got sad news for you. It's simple supply and demand. The government subsidizes college educations. So, demand for college education increases. Universities, seeing this sharp rise in demand (which is nearly perfectly inelastic due to the government subsidizing it), raise their prices to match the demand, which can't actually be matched because it's perfectly inelastic. Thus, we have 300% real inflation on tuition cost and all of these invaluable educations we subsidized can't actually produce economic growth because they're stuck for the next 10-15 years in 9-5 corporate jobs (or at coffee shops, which is about equally as likely right now), paying off their student loans with low-risk jobs. 

This is just one abstracted example of the overarching idea. As you grow older, get out of college, and learn how the world actually works, you quickly realize that *everything* handled by the government could be handled many orders of magnitude more efficiently by an unfettered market that is subjected to competition and consumer preference.",0,1476684752,Thekrayze,[0. 1. 0. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
